Spaced Repetition Reader
========================
Spaced repetition is a study technique for improving retention of information
that comes in the form of memorized key-value associations, by repeating
flashcards on a schedule with exponentially increasing spacing. However, using
spaced repetition in practice has a problem: it requires maintaining a habit,
but people who try to do it tend to fall out of the habit because reviewing
flashcards isn't a very rewarding activity.

This project attempts to solve that problem by hybridizing a spaced repetition
system with an RSS reader. The idea is, you subscribe to RSS feeds that are
rewarding to read (eg webcomics), and when new posts appear in these feeds,
they're mixed into your flashcard decks.

Setup
=====
First run `yarn install`. Then set up a locally running postgres database: run
`psql -d postgres`, and in the SQL shell run:
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE spacedrepetitionreader;
    CREATE USER spacedrepetitionreader WITH PASSWORD '<INSERTPASSWORDHERE>';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE spacedrepetitionreader TO spacedrepetitionreader;
    \c spacedrepetitionreader
    GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO spacedrepetitionreader;
    ```
Next, edit config.js, in particular adding the the database password you set
in the previous step to the connection string. Finally, initialize the database
to empty with
    ```
    yarn prisma db push
    ```
