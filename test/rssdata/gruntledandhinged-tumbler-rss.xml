Solar panel and wind turbine components have to come from somewhere. And you need well, a bunch of them to produce energy. Both require batteries full of toxic components to store energy for when generation is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are, I want to reiterate, much cleaner and safer energies than fossil fule based energy. They are available now and we should be using them. But they are also not truly long term solutions to the need for power, any more than nuclear fission is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now there&amp;rsquo;s a way out, a path forward. Humanity bites the bullet and uses solar, wind, geothermic, and hydroelectric to bridge the gap because now it&amp;rsquo;s not an infinite gap. Somewhere in the next 10-50 years we&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a fusion power plant built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalism will undoubtedly slow things down and restrict this vital technology to the richest countries. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying the fight is over, I&amp;rsquo;m saying that &lt;i&gt;a win condition exists at all&lt;/i&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the holy grail of energy. This is energy where we build the plants then basically just maintain them and there is no pollution. There is no having to keep harvesting the Earth, or birds flying into turbines, or requiring massive amounts of components to harvest the energy like solar. This works in dark places, at night, in the desert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt hope for a long time. I am feeling it right now. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and it is a tiny star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s still so fucking surreal to me. for so long &amp;ldquo;fusion&amp;rdquo; was the word of unrealistic hopes, of far-off dreams that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen for a thousand years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we fucking did it. we proved that net-energy-gain fusion is possible and that we have the technology to do it. it&amp;rsquo;s not much - about enough to boil a few kettles&amp;rsquo; worth of water - but it&amp;rsquo;s still an energy gain from fusion, something only the stars could do before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s gonna be tons of pushback. fossil fuel companies will inevitably cry and try to get fusion labs shut down. there&amp;rsquo;s a fight ahead of us, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that i can see us winning. one day - maybe in our lifetime, maybe in that of the next generation - humanity will be powered almost entirely by fusion reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the future is bright, lit by a piece of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a stupid, useless metric they have gamed to make it look like they’ve achieved meaningful power generation, when not only have they not (they put &amp;gt;10x the energy in that they got out), it’s not even clearly better than the best previously existing fusion methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, the thing they achieved net positive energy on was &lt;i&gt;more out than the laser shone in&lt;/i&gt;. Lasers, notably, are grotesquely inefficient; if you pump 100 kJ of electricity into a laser you’re going to convey 10 kJ or less to the thing you’re shining it onto. Shorter distances help, as do higher energies, but not that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="npf_row"&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="380" data-orig-width="624"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/fcf8c18af9acf616e65caabaa6b3ee28/9dfca67a7fdba26d-f1/s640x960/98b96f7c36a292b5f7c72b27ce573110d69ca743.jpg" data-orig-height="380" data-orig-width="624"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is from last year, but the important part is that the ‘net positive’ part is exclusively that last, thinnest blue bar.

&lt;p&gt;I use this with my hospice patients a lot. Because “is there anything I can do to help?” rarely gets a response. But, “I’ll be here till 6:30 and would like to do one thing to make your room more comfortable before I head out”  frequently does get an answer. Often something they deem “too small to bug anyone with” like closing the blinds so there’s no reflection on the tv, or repositioning their socks because the heels have wandered into the front and are uncomfortable, or they want ice cream before dinner today, or getting an extra blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="tumblr_blog" href="https://lightheartedsuggestion.tumblr.com/post/625863490140307456" target="_blank"&gt;lightheartedsuggestion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s going to make you happy right now? Is it some cake? Is it a nap? Is it calling your mom? Is it going on a drive and blasting music? Is it taking a bath? Is it reading a book? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check in with yourself because you deserve that happiness, whatever it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use this on myself. What’s one thing I could do to make my environment more comfortable right now? Does it cure my mental illness? Hell no! Does it make me feel more in control of my feelings and the world around me? You betcha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to apply this to my current situation, since right now things feel very out of control. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/rthko/703121042539954176/theres-something-deeply-political-about-which" class="tumblr_blog" target="_blank"&gt;rthko&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s something deeply political about which fears are normalized, regardless of how irrational or statistically unlikely they may be. To tell the truth I really don’t think much about crime. Have I lived an easy life? In some ways, but there are people with lives a lot easier than mine who are afraid to the point of total dysfunction of getting stabbed or mugged. Who then gleefully endorse the excessive isolation, codependence, and gender-based hierarchies that enable the more likely violence committed by people who actually know each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told my bosses at my last job I was taking a weekend trip to Chicago and they said “gosh, be safe,” as if Chicago is nothing more than the Fox News “Chi-raq” depiction and not a multifaceted region with world-class museums, beautiful scenery, and endless joys and new experiences to be had, even (especially) outside the glitsy tourist areas. They are depraving themselves of all this joy and think all the sensory experiences they need can be found at an Olive Garden surrounded by a sea of asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to be afraid of getting hit by a car is a problem for whiny libcucks who should just buy a truck instead, to be afraid when politicians and TV personalities explicitly call for your murder as a queer person is a matter of “hurt feelings,” and women are told to fear serial killers who jump out of alleys with zipties and told to get over their anxieties about intimate partner violence. None of it makes any sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea of this post is correct (what gets to count as normal healthy fear and what gets to count as irrelevant personal anxieties is heavily politicised) but the implementation seems to be “Ppl should stop self-inducing paranoia about rightwing fearbait memes and start self-inducing paranoia about &lt;i&gt;leftwing&lt;/i&gt; fearbait memes”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have watched ppl work themselves into dysfunction about IPV and queerbashing as well, and who have frequently offloaded this fear onto others around them in frankly dangerous and destructive ways (credulously badgering ppl into believing all reports of abuse and ostracising all alleged abusers without question, arming themselves in situations where they are much more likely to get themselves or their friends shot than hypothetical violent homophobes, etc). So I think it’s important not to realise this and just substitute one politicised limbic system memeplex for another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><link>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/703251674436927488</link><guid>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/703251674436927488</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 06:50:59 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>raginrayguns:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;on the internet you can see all the horrible people that are out there proudly displaying their cruelty, but they pretty much can’t do anything to you. I don’t care so much about whether we can get them to stop, as whether I will be forced into circumstances where I can’t escape them. Prison, bureaucracy, poverty, can all do that. And I guess politically, I’m not so interested in fixing everyone as enabling the rest of us to live free of interference from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><link>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/685998790325518336</link><guid>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/685998790325518336</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 21:23:47 -0400</pubDate></item><item><description>&lt;div class="npf_row"&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"&gt;&lt;img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e2581225d59146198d0e4316d16fadf2/c34327b70e6dfbe1-36/s640x960/e1fa8fea9d5424eb16d9230f977471f58120d437.jpg" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-width="2448"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I look like these days &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/669136309083947008</link><guid>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/669136309083947008</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 17:21:52 -0500</pubDate><category>my face makes faces</category></item><item><title>Could you tag ED posts?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Yes!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“On a visit back to my college, while my son was off meeting a friend, I sidled up to the student at the desk in admissions. I told her I was an alumna and my child was thinking about applying, but he was concerned about one thing: fraternities. Did she feel the fraternities still dominated the social scene as they had in my day? And if so, was that okay? Did she feel safe there? She responded cheerfully that indeed fraternities were a big part of the college’s social life, but that it was no problem: When she went to a frat party, she just made sure to bring a girlfriend with her! “Great!” I said. “Thank you!” And I went to tell my son that he was right. Not only did fraternities still rule, but the fact that they were dangerous was so shruggingly accepted that smart young women planned for it. Remind me again — why do we still tolerate these places?”&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/01/its-time-abolish-college-fraternities/" target="_blank"&gt;It’s time to abolish college fraternities &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh no. If we get rid of frats, how will toxic masculinity perpetuate itself. Someone think of the douchebags and predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><link>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/666692696717590528</link><guid>https://gruntledandhinged.tumblr.com/post/666692696717590528</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:01:41 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>dancing-thru-clouds:silver-tongues-blog:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“But [Tumblr’s] value, of course, is more than just what it isn’t, and what it points away from. Despite all the drama and discourse lurking in its corners, it’s easy to make your own Tumblr life as simple and as happy as you want it to be. There are no algorithmic threats lurking around every corner, no onslaught of promoted posts from politicians or influencers. More than anything else, Tumblr in 2020 is a self-sustaining ecosystem. It’s a semi-sealed and increasingly fertile terrarium, a nigh-impossible perpetual-motion machine of a platform going productively psychotic in its isolation.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;— &lt;a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mhUPTQSQDA6b4GotbgSNCeA" target="_blank"&gt;@areyougonnabe&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a href="https://www.fansplaining.com/articles/the-ever-mutating-life-of-tumblr-dot-com" target="_blank"&gt;The Ever-Mutating Life of Tumblr Dot Com&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, going productively psychotic in isolation is this year’s mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
